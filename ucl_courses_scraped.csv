Your third year is spent studying abroad at one of our partner institutions, where you will study modules in archaeology and related subjects. This is an exciting opportunity to develop your understanding of the theory and practice of archaeology outside the UK. You will benefit from the expertise and advice of UCL’s Study Abroad Office as well as our departmental Study Abroad Tutor. You will need to be in good academic standing and linguistically competent for your exchange destination.  In the final year, you are given the chance to reflect critically on your fieldwork experience and the skills you have been developing during the degree through a portfolio, and write a 10,000-word dissertation on a detailed subject that you will choose, research and write up with the support of a supervisor.

Accepted QualificationsAny combination of the qualifications listed below, with no specific subject requirements. Unless you meet Group Two of the non-academic entry requirements, you should have studied for these qualifications at a UK state school:

A levels
International Baccalaureate Diploma
Access to HE Diploma – preferably related to an engineering discipline
BTEC Level 3 Extended Diploma – preferably related to an engineering discipline
Scottish Advanced Highers
Cambridge Pre-U Principal Subjects
T Levels

Other Level 3 qualifications that confer UCAS points may still be considered but could be less competitive. You can contact the Engineering Foundation Year team to see how these will be assessed.
You will not be eligible if you have completed a Level 4 qualification or higher (for example, a Higher National Certificate) or more than one year of an undergraduate degree.
GCSEsCurrently, the GCSE entry requirements are C or 4 in both GCSE English Language and Mathematics. 
NotesMature and forced migrant applicants only: Please note that we also consider qualifications not listed above, and the work experience of mature applicants, on a case-by-case basis.  If you do not have the qualifications listed above, please contact us at efy@ucl.ac.uk before submitting your application, providing the full title of your qualifications, the country in which you studied, and the grade(s) you achieved to seek guidance about your suitability for the programme. However, please bear in mind that we cannot always confirm your academic eligibility before we have reviewed your application.
The Engineering Foundation Year is intended for students who would not otherwise be able to study at UCL. If your predicted or actual grades would make you eligible for direct entry to Year 1 of the direct entry programme, including through the Access UCL Scheme, we will not consider your application and may transfer it for consideration to the direct entry programme.
If you are admitted to the Engineering Foundation Year and subsequently achieve grades that would have been sufficient for the direct entry programme, this will not mean you can transfer to Year 1 of the direct entry programme instead of taking the Engineering Foundation Year.




Eligibility for UK/home fee statusApplicants to the Engineering Foundation Year must be eligible to pay UK fees as determined by UCL Admissions.  This particular programme is part of UCL’s commitment to increase diversity in the student cohort, aiming to address discrepancies in the take-up of higher education opportunities between different underrepresented groups of UK students. If you are not eligible for UK fees you may wish to consider UCL's International Foundation Year.UCL reserves the right to determine this at any point in the application process, and if determined to be overseas, the application will no longer be considered.
Important:UCL Admissions review and where necessary update definitions to the below criteria annually. Applications for 2026 entry will be assessed based on the review due in September 2025. Once this review has taken place, this notice (and if necessary, the definitions) will be updated. You must meet one of the criteria in either Group One or Group Two.
Group One
In addition to meeting one of the following criteria, you must also have studied the qualifications to meet the academic entry requirements for this programme at a UK State School.
Postcode eligibilityApplicants who live in an area that has a high level of financial, social or economic deprivation, or low participation in higher education.
UCL use the Index of Multiple of Deprivation to identify levels of financial, social or economic deprivation, and TUNDRA to measure participation rates.
Eligibility for free school mealsEngland: Applicants who were known to be eligible for free school meals at the end of Key Stage 4 (Year 11) and/or six years prior to this point.
Northern Ireland: Applicants who were known to be eligible for free school meals in the six years prior to Year 12.

EstrangedUCL’s definition of estrangement is that you must be permanently estranged from both parents with no support from, or contact with, either parent for at least a year. This does not apply to single-parent families, where you are still in contact with one parent. You must be under 25 on your first day at UCL.
Note: If you have been in local authority care, you may be considered ‘care experienced’ rather than ‘estranged’.
Educational gapApplicants who have experienced an educational gap of more than one year (e.g. leaving school at 16 but returning to complete a Level 3 qualification after several years in work). Deferred or ‘gap’ years between school and university are not considered under this criterion.
Group Two
You must meet one of the following criteria:
Care experiencedWe define someone as care experienced if they have 1) studied at a UK school for their Level 3 qualifications and 2) been looked after by a local authority or been in kinship care as a formal agreement with the local authority, for three months (at least 84 days) in their life. The months do not need to be consecutive. You must be under 25 on your first day at UCL.
Forced migrantWe use the term 'forced migrant' to mean one of the following:

Refugee
Asylum seeker
Those who have been granted a temporary form of leave as the result of an asylum or human rights application (e.g. limited leave to remain, discretionary leave to remain, humanitarian protection, UASC leave).

We will assess applications from forced migrants on a case-by-case basis.
Mature studentThose who are 21 or older on the day they start their first undergraduate degree.
We will assess applications from mature students on a case-by-case basis, taking into account your work experience.

Accepted QualificationsAny combination of the qualifications listed below, with no specific subject requirements. Unless you meet Group Two of the non-academic entry requirements, you should have studied for these qualifications at a UK state school:

A levels
International Baccalaureate Diploma
Access to HE Diploma – preferably related to an engineering discipline
BTEC Level 3 Extended Diploma – preferably related to an engineering discipline
Scottish Advanced Highers
Cambridge Pre-U Principal Subjects
T Levels

Other Level 3 qualifications that confer UCAS points may still be considered but could be less competitive. You can contact the Engineering Foundation Year team to see how these will be assessed.
You will not be eligible if you have completed a Level 4 qualification or higher (for example, a Higher National Certificate) or more than one year of an undergraduate degree.
GCSEsCurrently, the GCSE entry requirements are C or 4 in both GCSE English Language and Mathematics. 
NotesMature and forced migrant applicants only: Please note that we also consider qualifications not listed above, and the work experience of mature applicants, on a case-by-case basis.  If you do not have the qualifications listed above, please contact us at efy@ucl.ac.uk before submitting your application, providing the full title of your qualifications, the country in which you studied, and the grade(s) you achieved to seek guidance about your suitability for the programme. However, please bear in mind that we cannot always confirm your academic eligibility before we have reviewed your application.
The Engineering Foundation Year is intended for students who would not otherwise be able to study at UCL. If your predicted or actual grades would make you eligible for direct entry to Year 1 of the direct entry programme, including through the Access UCL Scheme, we will not consider your application and may transfer it for consideration to the direct entry programme.
If you are admitted to the Engineering Foundation Year and subsequently achieve grades that would have been sufficient for the direct entry programme, this will not mean you can transfer to Year 1 of the direct entry programme instead of taking the Engineering Foundation Year.




Eligibility for UK/home fee statusApplicants to the Engineering Foundation Year must be eligible to pay UK fees as determined by UCL Admissions.  This particular programme is part of UCL’s commitment to increase diversity in the student cohort, aiming to address discrepancies in the take-up of higher education opportunities between different underrepresented groups of UK students. If you are not eligible for UK fees you may wish to consider UCL's International Foundation Year.UCL reserves the right to determine this at any point in the application process, and if determined to be overseas, the application will no longer be considered.
Important:UCL Admissions review and where necessary update definitions to the below criteria annually. Applications for 2026 entry will be assessed based on the review due in September 2025. Once this review has taken place, this notice (and if necessary, the definitions) will be updated. You must meet one of the criteria in either Group One or Group Two.
Group One
In addition to meeting one of the following criteria, you must also have studied the qualifications to meet the academic entry requirements for this programme at a UK State School.
Postcode eligibilityApplicants who live in an area that has a high level of financial, social or economic deprivation, or low participation in higher education.
UCL use the Index of Multiple of Deprivation to identify levels of financial, social or economic deprivation, and TUNDRA to measure participation rates.
Eligibility for free school mealsEngland: Applicants who were known to be eligible for free school meals at the end of Key Stage 4 (Year 11) and/or six years prior to this point.
Northern Ireland: Applicants who were known to be eligible for free school meals in the six years prior to Year 12.

Accepted QualificationsAny combination of the qualifications listed below, with no specific subject requirements. Unless you meet Group Two of the non-academic entry requirements, you should have studied for these qualifications at a UK state school:

A levels
International Baccalaureate Diploma
Access to HE Diploma – preferably related to an engineering discipline
BTEC Level 3 Extended Diploma – preferably related to an engineering discipline
Scottish Advanced Highers
Cambridge Pre-U Principal Subjects
T Levels

Other Level 3 qualifications that confer UCAS points may still be considered but could be less competitive. You can contact the Engineering Foundation Year team to see how these will be assessed.
You will not be eligible if you have completed a Level 4 qualification or higher (for example, a Higher National Certificate) or more than one year of an undergraduate degree.
GCSEsCurrently, the GCSE entry requirements are C or 4 in both GCSE English Language and Mathematics. 
NotesMature and forced migrant applicants only: Please note that we also consider qualifications not listed above, and the work experience of mature applicants, on a case-by-case basis.  If you do not have the qualifications listed above, please contact us at efy@ucl.ac.uk before submitting your application, providing the full title of your qualifications, the country in which you studied, and the grade(s) you achieved to seek guidance about your suitability for the programme. However, please bear in mind that we cannot always confirm your academic eligibility before we have reviewed your application.
The Engineering Foundation Year is intended for students who would not otherwise be able to study at UCL. If your predicted or actual grades would make you eligible for direct entry to Year 1 of the direct entry programme, including through the Access UCL Scheme, we will not consider your application and may transfer it for consideration to the direct entry programme.
If you are admitted to the Engineering Foundation Year and subsequently achieve grades that would have been sufficient for the direct entry programme, this will not mean you can transfer to Year 1 of the direct entry programme instead of taking the Engineering Foundation Year.




Eligibility for UK/home fee statusApplicants to the Engineering Foundation Year must be eligible to pay UK fees as determined by UCL Admissions.  This particular programme is part of UCL’s commitment to increase diversity in the student cohort, aiming to address discrepancies in the take-up of higher education opportunities between different underrepresented groups of UK students. If you are not eligible for UK fees you may wish to consider UCL's International Foundation Year.UCL reserves the right to determine this at any point in the application process, and if determined to be overseas, the application will no longer be considered.
Important:UCL Admissions review and where necessary update definitions to the below criteria annually. Applications for 2026 entry will be assessed based on the review due in September 2025. Once this review has taken place, this notice (and if necessary, the definitions) will be updated. You must meet one of the criteria in either Group One or Group Two.
Group One
In addition to meeting one of the following criteria, you must also have studied the qualifications to meet the academic entry requirements for this programme at a UK State School.
Postcode eligibilityApplicants who live in an area that has a high level of financial, social or economic deprivation, or low participation in higher education.
UCL use the Index of Multiple of Deprivation to identify levels of financial, social or economic deprivation, and TUNDRA to measure participation rates.
Eligibility for free school mealsEngland: Applicants who were known to be eligible for free school meals at the end of Key Stage 4 (Year 11) and/or six years prior to this point.
Northern Ireland: Applicants who were known to be eligible for free school meals in the six years prior to Year 12.
Wales: Applicants who were known to be eligible for free school meals between the start of Year 11 and the January five years prior to this.
EstrangedUCL’s definition of estrangement is that you must be permanently estranged from both parents with no support from, or contact with, either parent for at least a year. This does not apply to single-parent families, where you are still in contact with one parent. You must be under 25 on your first day at UCL.
Note: If you have been in local authority care, you may be considered ‘care experienced’ rather than ‘estranged’.
Educational gapApplicants who have experienced an educational gap of more than one year (e.g. leaving school at 16 but returning to complete a Level 3 qualification after several years in work). Deferred or ‘gap’ years between school and university are not considered under this criterion.
Group Two
You must meet one of the following criteria:
Care experiencedWe define someone as care experienced if they have 1) studied at a UK school for their Level 3 qualifications and 2) been looked after by a local authority or been in kinship care as a formal agreement with the local authority, for three months (at least 84 days) in their life. The months do not need to be consecutive. You must be under 25 on your first day at UCL.
Forced migrantWe use the term 'forced migrant' to mean one of the following:

Refugee
Asylum seeker
Those who have been granted a temporary form of leave as the result of an asylum or human rights application (e.g. limited leave to remain, discretionary leave to remain, humanitarian protection, UASC leave).

We will assess applications from forced migrants on a case-by-case basis.
Mature studentThose who are 21 or older on the day they start their first undergraduate degree.
We will assess applications from mature students on a case-by-case basis, taking into account your work experience.

EstrangedUCL’s definition of estrangement is that you must be permanently estranged from both parents with no support from, or contact with, either parent for at least a year. This does not apply to single-parent families, where you are still in contact with one parent. You must be under 25 on your first day at UCL.
Note: If you have been in local authority care, you may be considered ‘care experienced’ rather than ‘estranged’.
Educational gapApplicants who have experienced an educational gap of more than one year (e.g. leaving school at 16 but returning to complete a Level 3 qualification after several years in work). Deferred or ‘gap’ years between school and university are not considered under this criterion.
Group Two
You must meet one of the following criteria:
Care experiencedWe define someone as care experienced if they have 1) studied at a UK school for their Level 3 qualifications and 2) been looked after by a local authority or been in kinship care as a formal agreement with the local authority, for three months (at least 84 days) in their life. The months do not need to be consecutive. You must be under 25 on your first day at UCL.

Accepted QualificationsAny combination of the qualifications listed below, with no specific subject requirements. Unless you meet Group Two of the non-academic entry requirements, you should have studied for these qualifications at a UK state school:

A levels
International Baccalaureate Diploma
Access to HE Diploma – preferably related to an engineering discipline
BTEC Level 3 Extended Diploma – preferably related to an engineering discipline
Scottish Advanced Highers
Cambridge Pre-U Principal Subjects
T Levels

Other Level 3 qualifications that confer UCAS points may still be considered but could be less competitive. You can contact the Engineering Foundation Year team to see how these will be assessed.
You will not be eligible if you have completed a Level 4 qualification or higher (for example, a Higher National Certificate) or more than one year of an undergraduate degree.
GCSEsCurrently, the GCSE entry requirements are C or 4 in both GCSE English Language and Mathematics. 
NotesMature and forced migrant applicants only: Please note that we also consider qualifications not listed above, and the work experience of mature applicants, on a case-by-case basis.  If you do not have the qualifications listed above, please contact us at efy@ucl.ac.uk before submitting your application, providing the full title of your qualifications, the country in which you studied, and the grade(s) you achieved to seek guidance about your suitability for the programme. However, please bear in mind that we cannot always confirm your academic eligibility before we have reviewed your application.
The Engineering Foundation Year is intended for students who would not otherwise be able to study at UCL. If your predicted or actual grades would make you eligible for direct entry to Year 1 of the direct entry programme, including through the Access UCL Scheme, we will not consider your application and may transfer it for consideration to the direct entry programme.
If you are admitted to the Engineering Foundation Year and subsequently achieve grades that would have been sufficient for the direct entry programme, this will not mean you can transfer to Year 1 of the direct entry programme instead of taking the Engineering Foundation Year.




Eligibility for UK/home fee statusApplicants to the Engineering Foundation Year must be eligible to pay UK fees as determined by UCL Admissions.  This particular programme is part of UCL’s commitment to increase diversity in the student cohort, aiming to address discrepancies in the take-up of higher education opportunities between different underrepresented groups of UK students. If you are not eligible for UK fees you may wish to consider UCL's International Foundation Year.UCL reserves the right to determine this at any point in the application process, and if determined to be overseas, the application will no longer be considered.
Important:UCL Admissions review and where necessary update definitions to the below criteria annually. Applications for 2026 entry will be assessed based on the review due in September 2025. Once this review has taken place, this notice (and if necessary, the definitions) will be updated. You must meet one of the criteria in either Group One or Group Two.
Group One

Accepted QualificationsAny combination of the qualifications listed below, with no specific subject requirements. Unless you meet Group Two of the non-academic entry requirements, you should have studied for these qualifications at a UK state school:

A levels
International Baccalaureate Diploma
Access to HE Diploma – preferably related to an engineering discipline
BTEC Level 3 Extended Diploma – preferably related to an engineering discipline
Scottish Advanced Highers
Cambridge Pre-U Principal Subjects
T Levels

Other Level 3 qualifications that confer UCAS points may still be considered but could be less competitive. You can contact the Engineering Foundation Year team to see how these will be assessed.
You will not be eligible if you have completed a Level 4 qualification or higher (for example, a Higher National Certificate) or more than one year of an undergraduate degree.
GCSEsCurrently, the GCSE entry requirements are C or 4 in both GCSE English Language and Mathematics. 
NotesMature and forced migrant applicants only: Please note that we also consider qualifications not listed above, and the work experience of mature applicants, on a case-by-case basis.  If you do not have the qualifications listed above, please contact us at efy@ucl.ac.uk before submitting your application, providing the full title of your qualifications, the country in which you studied, and the grade(s) you achieved to seek guidance about your suitability for the programme. However, please bear in mind that we cannot always confirm your academic eligibility before we have reviewed your application.
The Engineering Foundation Year is intended for students who would not otherwise be able to study at UCL. If your predicted or actual grades would make you eligible for direct entry to Year 1 of the direct entry programme, including through the Access UCL Scheme, we will not consider your application and may transfer it for consideration to the direct entry programme.
If you are admitted to the Engineering Foundation Year and subsequently achieve grades that would have been sufficient for the direct entry programme, this will not mean you can transfer to Year 1 of the direct entry programme instead of taking the Engineering Foundation Year.




Eligibility for UK/home fee statusApplicants to the Engineering Foundation Year must be eligible to pay UK fees as determined by UCL Admissions.  This particular programme is part of UCL’s commitment to increase diversity in the student cohort, aiming to address discrepancies in the take-up of higher education opportunities between different underrepresented groups of UK students. If you are not eligible for UK fees you may wish to consider UCL's International Foundation Year.UCL reserves the right to determine this at any point in the application process, and if determined to be overseas, the application will no longer be considered.
Important:UCL Admissions review and where necessary update definitions to the below criteria annually. Applications for 2026 entry will be assessed based on the review due in September 2025. Once this review has taken place, this notice (and if necessary, the definitions) will be updated. You must meet one of the criteria in either Group One or Group Two.
Group One
In addition to meeting one of the following criteria, you must also have studied the qualifications to meet the academic entry requirements for this programme at a UK State School.
Postcode eligibilityApplicants who live in an area that has a high level of financial, social or economic deprivation, or low participation in higher education.
UCL use the Index of Multiple of Deprivation to identify levels of financial, social or economic deprivation, and TUNDRA to measure participation rates.
Eligibility for free school mealsEngland: Applicants who were known to be eligible for free school meals at the end of Key Stage 4 (Year 11) and/or six years prior to this point.
Northern Ireland: Applicants who were known to be eligible for free school meals in the six years prior to Year 12.
Wales: Applicants who were known to be eligible for free school meals between the start of Year 11 and the January five years prior to this.
EstrangedUCL’s definition of estrangement is that you must be permanently estranged from both parents with no support from, or contact with, either parent for at least a year. This does not apply to single-parent families, where you are still in contact with one parent. You must be under 25 on your first day at UCL.
Note: If you have been in local authority care, you may be considered ‘care experienced’ rather than ‘estranged’.
Educational gapApplicants who have experienced an educational gap of more than one year (e.g. leaving school at 16 but returning to complete a Level 3 qualification after several years in work). Deferred or ‘gap’ years between school and university are not considered under this criterion.
Group Two
You must meet one of the following criteria:
Care experiencedWe define someone as care experienced if they have 1) studied at a UK school for their Level 3 qualifications and 2) been looked after by a local authority or been in kinship care as a formal agreement with the local authority, for three months (at least 84 days) in their life. The months do not need to be consecutive. You must be under 25 on your first day at UCL.
Forced migrantWe use the term 'forced migrant' to mean one of the following:

Refugee
Asylum seeker
Those who have been granted a temporary form of leave as the result of an asylum or human rights application (e.g. limited leave to remain, discretionary leave to remain, humanitarian protection, UASC leave).

We will assess applications from forced migrants on a case-by-case basis.
Mature studentThose who are 21 or older on the day they start their first undergraduate degree.
We will assess applications from mature students on a case-by-case basis, taking into account your work experience.

Accepted QualificationsAny combination of the qualifications listed below, with no specific subject requirements. Unless you meet Group Two of the non-academic entry requirements, you should have studied for these qualifications at a UK state school:

A levels
International Baccalaureate Diploma
Access to HE Diploma – preferably related to an engineering discipline
BTEC Level 3 Extended Diploma – preferably related to an engineering discipline
Scottish Advanced Highers
Cambridge Pre-U Principal Subjects
T Levels

Other Level 3 qualifications that confer UCAS points may still be considered but could be less competitive. You can contact the Engineering Foundation Year team to see how these will be assessed.
You will not be eligible if you have completed a Level 4 qualification or higher (for example, a Higher National Certificate) or more than one year of an undergraduate degree.
GCSEsCurrently, the GCSE entry requirements are C or 4 in both GCSE English Language and Mathematics. 
NotesMature and forced migrant applicants only: Please note that we also consider qualifications not listed above, and the work experience of mature applicants, on a case-by-case basis.  If you do not have the qualifications listed above, please contact us at efy@ucl.ac.uk before submitting your application, providing the full title of your qualifications, the country in which you studied, and the grade(s) you achieved to seek guidance about your suitability for the programme. However, please bear in mind that we cannot always confirm your academic eligibility before we have reviewed your application.
The Engineering Foundation Year is intended for students who would not otherwise be able to study at UCL. If your predicted or actual grades would make you eligible for direct entry to Year 1 of the direct entry programme, including through the Access UCL Scheme, we will not consider your application and may transfer it for consideration to the direct entry programme.
If you are admitted to the Engineering Foundation Year and subsequently achieve grades that would have been sufficient for the direct entry programme, this will not mean you can transfer to Year 1 of the direct entry programme instead of taking the Engineering Foundation Year.




Eligibility for UK/home fee statusApplicants to the Engineering Foundation Year must be eligible to pay UK fees as determined by UCL Admissions.  This particular programme is part of UCL’s commitment to increase diversity in the student cohort, aiming to address discrepancies in the take-up of higher education opportunities between different underrepresented groups of UK students. If you are not eligible for UK fees you may wish to consider UCL's International Foundation Year.UCL reserves the right to determine this at any point in the application process, and if determined to be overseas, the application will no longer be considered.
Important:UCL Admissions review and where necessary update definitions to the below criteria annually. Applications for 2026 entry will be assessed based on the review due in September 2025. Once this review has taken place, this notice (and if necessary, the definitions) will be updated. You must meet one of the criteria in either Group One or Group Two.
Group One
In addition to meeting one of the following criteria, you must also have studied the qualifications to meet the academic entry requirements for this programme at a UK State School.
Postcode eligibilityApplicants who live in an area that has a high level of financial, social or economic deprivation, or low participation in higher education.
UCL use the Index of Multiple of Deprivation to identify levels of financial, social or economic deprivation, and TUNDRA to measure participation rates.
Eligibility for free school mealsEngland: Applicants who were known to be eligible for free school meals at the end of Key Stage 4 (Year 11) and/or six years prior to this point.
Northern Ireland: Applicants who were known to be eligible for free school meals in the six years prior to Year 12.
Wales: Applicants who were known to be eligible for free school meals between the start of Year 11 and the January five years prior to this.
EstrangedUCL’s definition of estrangement is that you must be permanently estranged from both parents with no support from, or contact with, either parent for at least a year. This does not apply to single-parent families, where you are still in contact with one parent. You must be under 25 on your first day at UCL.
Note: If you have been in local authority care, you may be considered ‘care experienced’ rather than ‘estranged’.
Educational gapApplicants who have experienced an educational gap of more than one year (e.g. leaving school at 16 but returning to complete a Level 3 qualification after several years in work). Deferred or ‘gap’ years between school and university are not considered under this criterion.
Group Two
You must meet one of the following criteria:
Care experiencedWe define someone as care experienced if they have 1) studied at a UK school for their Level 3 qualifications and 2) been looked after by a local authority or been in kinship care as a formal agreement with the local authority, for three months (at least 84 days) in their life. The months do not need to be consecutive. You must be under 25 on your first day at UCL.
Forced migrantWe use the term 'forced migrant' to mean one of the following:

Refugee
Asylum seeker
Those who have been granted a temporary form of leave as the result of an asylum or human rights application (e.g. limited leave to remain, discretionary leave to remain, humanitarian protection, UASC leave).

We will assess applications from forced migrants on a case-by-case basis.
Mature studentThose who are 21 or older on the day they start their first undergraduate degree.
We will assess applications from mature students on a case-by-case basis, taking into account your work experience.

Accepted QualificationsAny combination of the qualifications listed below, with no specific subject requirements. Unless you meet Group Two of the non-academic entry requirements, you should have studied for these qualifications at a UK state school:

A levels
International Baccalaureate Diploma
Access to HE Diploma – preferably related to an engineering discipline
BTEC Level 3 Extended Diploma – preferably related to an engineering discipline
Scottish Advanced Highers
Cambridge Pre-U Principal Subjects
T Levels

Other Level 3 qualifications that confer UCAS points may still be considered but could be less competitive. You can contact the Engineering Foundation Year team to see how these will be assessed.
You will not be eligible if you have completed a Level 4 qualification or higher (for example, a Higher National Certificate) or more than one year of an undergraduate degree.
GCSEsCurrently, the GCSE entry requirements are C or 4 in both GCSE English Language and Mathematics. 
NotesMature and forced migrant applicants only: Please note that we also consider qualifications not listed above, and the work experience of mature applicants, on a case-by-case basis.  If you do not have the qualifications listed above, please contact us at efy@ucl.ac.uk before submitting your application, providing the full title of your qualifications, the country in which you studied, and the grade(s) you achieved to seek guidance about your suitability for the programme. However, please bear in mind that we cannot always confirm your academic eligibility before we have reviewed your application.
The Engineering Foundation Year is intended for students who would not otherwise be able to study at UCL. If your predicted or actual grades would make you eligible for direct entry to Year 1 of the direct entry programme, including through the Access UCL Scheme, we will not consider your application and may transfer it for consideration to the direct entry programme.
If you are admitted to the Engineering Foundation Year and subsequently achieve grades that would have been sufficient for the direct entry programme, this will not mean you can transfer to Year 1 of the direct entry programme instead of taking the Engineering Foundation Year.




Eligibility for UK/home fee statusApplicants to the Engineering Foundation Year must be eligible to pay UK fees as determined by UCL Admissions.  This particular programme is part of UCL’s commitment to increase diversity in the student cohort, aiming to address discrepancies in the take-up of higher education opportunities between different underrepresented groups of UK students. If you are not eligible for UK fees you may wish to consider UCL's International Foundation Year.UCL reserves the right to determine this at any point in the application process, and if determined to be overseas, the application will no longer be considered.
Important:UCL Admissions review and where necessary update definitions to the below criteria annually. Applications for 2026 entry will be assessed based on the review due in September 2025. Once this review has taken place, this notice (and if necessary, the definitions) will be updated. You must meet one of the criteria in either Group One or Group Two.
Group One
In addition to meeting one of the following criteria, you must also have studied the qualifications to meet the academic entry requirements for this programme at a UK State School.
Postcode eligibilityApplicants who live in an area that has a high level of financial, social or economic deprivation, or low participation in higher education.
UCL use the Index of Multiple of Deprivation to identify levels of financial, social or economic deprivation, and TUNDRA to measure participation rates.
Eligibility for free school mealsEngland: Applicants who were known to be eligible for free school meals at the end of Key Stage 4 (Year 11) and/or six years prior to this point.
Northern Ireland: Applicants who were known to be eligible for free school meals in the six years prior to Year 12.
Wales: Applicants who were known to be eligible for free school meals between the start of Year 11 and the January five years prior to this.
EstrangedUCL’s definition of estrangement is that you must be permanently estranged from both parents with no support from, or contact with, either parent for at least a year. This does not apply to single-parent families, where you are still in contact with one parent. You must be under 25 on your first day at UCL.
Note: If you have been in local authority care, you may be considered ‘care experienced’ rather than ‘estranged’.
Educational gapApplicants who have experienced an educational gap of more than one year (e.g. leaving school at 16 but returning to complete a Level 3 qualification after several years in work). Deferred or ‘gap’ years between school and university are not considered under this criterion.
Group Two
You must meet one of the following criteria:
Care experiencedWe define someone as care experienced if they have 1) studied at a UK school for their Level 3 qualifications and 2) been looked after by a local authority or been in kinship care as a formal agreement with the local authority, for three months (at least 84 days) in their life. The months do not need to be consecutive. You must be under 25 on your first day at UCL.
Forced migrantWe use the term 'forced migrant' to mean one of the following:

Refugee
Asylum seeker
Those who have been granted a temporary form of leave as the result of an asylum or human rights application (e.g. limited leave to remain, discretionary leave to remain, humanitarian protection, UASC leave).

We will assess applications from forced migrants on a case-by-case basis.
Mature studentThose who are 21 or older on the day they start their first undergraduate degree.
We will assess applications from mature students on a case-by-case basis, taking into account your work experience.

Accepted QualificationsAny combination of the qualifications listed below, with no specific subject requirements. Unless you meet Group Two of the non-academic entry requirements, you should have studied for these qualifications at a UK state school:

A levels
International Baccalaureate Diploma
Access to HE Diploma – preferably related to an engineering discipline
BTEC Level 3 Extended Diploma – preferably related to an engineering discipline
Scottish Advanced Highers
Cambridge Pre-U Principal Subjects
T Levels

Other Level 3 qualifications that confer UCAS points may still be considered but could be less competitive. You can contact the Engineering Foundation Year team to see how these will be assessed.
You will not be eligible if you have completed a Level 4 qualification or higher (for example, a Higher National Certificate) or more than one year of an undergraduate degree.
GCSEsCurrently, the GCSE entry requirements are C or 4 in both GCSE English Language and Mathematics. 
NotesMature and forced migrant applicants only: Please note that we also consider qualifications not listed above, and the work experience of mature applicants, on a case-by-case basis.  If you do not have the qualifications listed above, please contact us at efy@ucl.ac.uk before submitting your application, providing the full title of your qualifications, the country in which you studied, and the grade(s) you achieved to seek guidance about your suitability for the programme. However, please bear in mind that we cannot always confirm your academic eligibility before we have reviewed your application.
The Engineering Foundation Year is intended for students who would not otherwise be able to study at UCL. If your predicted or actual grades would make you eligible for direct entry to Year 1 of the direct entry programme, including through the Access UCL Scheme, we will not consider your application and may transfer it for consideration to the direct entry programme.
If you are admitted to the Engineering Foundation Year and subsequently achieve grades that would have been sufficient for the direct entry programme, this will not mean you can transfer to Year 1 of the direct entry programme instead of taking the Engineering Foundation Year.




Eligibility for UK/home fee statusApplicants to the Engineering Foundation Year must be eligible to pay UK fees as determined by UCL Admissions.  This particular programme is part of UCL’s commitment to increase diversity in the student cohort, aiming to address discrepancies in the take-up of higher education opportunities between different underrepresented groups of UK students. If you are not eligible for UK fees you may wish to consider UCL's International Foundation Year.UCL reserves the right to determine this at any point in the application process, and if determined to be overseas, the application will no longer be considered.
Important:UCL Admissions review and where necessary update definitions to the below criteria annually. Applications for 2026 entry will be assessed based on the review due in September 2025. Once this review has taken place, this notice (and if necessary, the definitions) will be updated. You must meet one of the criteria in either Group One or Group Two.
Group One
In addition to meeting one of the following criteria, you must also have studied the qualifications to meet the academic entry requirements for this programme at a UK State School.
Postcode eligibilityApplicants who live in an area that has a high level of financial, social or economic deprivation, or low participation in higher education.
UCL use the Index of Multiple of Deprivation to identify levels of financial, social or economic deprivation, and TUNDRA to measure participation rates.
Eligibility for free school mealsEngland: Applicants who were known to be eligible for free school meals at the end of Key Stage 4 (Year 11) and/or six years prior to this point.
Northern Ireland: Applicants who were known to be eligible for free school meals in the six years prior to Year 12.
Wales: Applicants who were known to be eligible for free school meals between the start of Year 11 and the January five years prior to this.
EstrangedUCL’s definition of estrangement is that you must be permanently estranged from both parents with no support from, or contact with, either parent for at least a year. This does not apply to single-parent families, where you are still in contact with one parent. You must be under 25 on your first day at UCL.
Note: If you have been in local authority care, you may be considered ‘care experienced’ rather than ‘estranged’.
Educational gapApplicants who have experienced an educational gap of more than one year (e.g. leaving school at 16 but returning to complete a Level 3 qualification after several years in work). Deferred or ‘gap’ years between school and university are not considered under this criterion.
Group Two
You must meet one of the following criteria:
Care experiencedWe define someone as care experienced if they have 1) studied at a UK school for their Level 3 qualifications and 2) been looked after by a local authority or been in kinship care as a formal agreement with the local authority, for three months (at least 84 days) in their life. The months do not need to be consecutive. You must be under 25 on your first day at UCL.
Forced migrantWe use the term 'forced migrant' to mean one of the following:

Refugee
Asylum seeker
Those who have been granted a temporary form of leave as the result of an asylum or human rights application (e.g. limited leave to remain, discretionary leave to remain, humanitarian protection, UASC leave).

We will assess applications from forced migrants on a case-by-case basis.
Mature studentThose who are 21 or older on the day they start their first undergraduate degree.
We will assess applications from mature students on a case-by-case basis, taking into account your work experience.
