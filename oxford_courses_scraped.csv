The various courses offered by the Faculty present both the major traditions and cultural trends of the regions studied and, in most cases, their modern developments. All courses include a combination of linguistic, literary, historic and cultural studies. There is a wide range of options in fields such as art and archaeology, history, literature, philosophy, religion and modern social studies.

Asian and Middle Eastern Studies has a long history in Oxford. The Bodleian and other libraries possess extensive collections. These include the Nizami Ganjavi Library, the KB Chen China Centre Library and the Bodleian Japanese Library which contain significant collections in their respective fields.

Around the corner from the Faculty building on Pusey Lane is the Ashmolean Museum, which houses superb collections relevant to Asian and Middle Eastern Studies. Nearby are also the Leopold Muller Memorial Library at the Clarendon Institute for Hebrew and Jewish Studies material, and the Bodleian Art, Archaeology and Ancient World Library.

Both disciplines have a long history: archaeology grew from 18th-century antiquarianism, while anthropology began even earlier in the first days of colonial encounter.

Today, both subjects involve a range of sophisticated approaches shared with the arts, social sciences and physical sciences.

"">Video of Archaeology and Anthropology at Oxford University

Oxford’s distinctive combination of archaeology and anthropology, studied over three years, offers an unusually broad perspective on human societies from early prehistory to the present.

The course offers a comprehensive guide to the richness and diversity of human cultural experience throughout space and time.

By choosing to study here you will be able to:

• explore how humans evolved
• get to grips with major transformational processes in human history such as the development of farming, the emergence of towns and trading systems and the spread of world religions
• learn why societies structure their families, economies and political systems in the ways that they do
• investigate how material culture represents and reproduces beliefs and ideologies.

Five Oxford institutions specialise in these subjects:

• The School of Archaeology
• The School of Anthropology and Museum Ethnography
• The Ashmolean Museum
• The Pitt Rivers Museum
• The Oxford University Museum of Natural History.

All five institutions play a key role in the provision of teaching for the degree."

There are two options: Classics with Asian and Middle Eastern Studies (Q8T9) and Asian and Middle Eastern Studies with Classics (T9Q8). In each case the subject mentioned first is the main subject (about two-thirds of the degree) and the second is an additional subject (about one-third of the degree).

This joint honours degree provides an exciting opportunity for students who want to focus on interdisciplinary studies. It enables students to explore the cultural development and crossover in places such as the Middle East, Iran, Egypt and India. You will study the relationship between the languages and cultures of the great monotheistic religions within their various Greek and Roman contexts.

Those who choose Arabic, Persian or Turkish as their main language for the Asian and Middle Eastern Studies with Classics degree will spend their second year undertaking immersive language study abroad.

Please note that the course video on this page was filmed prior to the renaming of the course and of the Bodleian Art, Archaeology and Ancient World Library.

Oxford is ideally placed for the combined study of Classics and Asian and Middle Eastern Studies, not least due to the numerous and varied teaching staff in each faculty, and the resources of the Ashmolean Museum, the Bodleian Art, Archaeology and Ancient World Library and the China Centre. The Nizami Ganjavi Library has core collections comprising Islamic, South Asian and Jewish Studies.

Oxford has the largest Classics faculty in the world, with over sixty full-time academic staff-members.

Modern Languages have been taught in Oxford since 1724. The faculty is the largest in the country, with a total intake of more than 250 students a year (including joint courses).

Undergraduate students have access to the Taylor Institution Library, the biggest research library in Britain devoted to modern languages, and the University’s central library the Bodleian, as well as many online resources. The University’s well-equipped Language Centre has resources specifically tailored to the needs of Modern Language students.

Language is at the centre of the Oxford course, making up around 50% of both first-year and final examinations. The course aims to teach spoken fluency in colloquial and more formal situations, as well as the ability to write essays in the foreign language, and the ability to translate into and out of the foreign language with accuracy and sensitivity to a range of vocabulary, styles and registers. You will also develop your reading skills to a high level.

The study of literature gives you an understanding of other cultures that cannot be acquired solely through learning the language. It leads you into areas such as:

• gender studies
• popular culture
• theatre
• aesthetics
• anthropology
• art history
• ethics
• history

The study of life at the molecular level continues to undergo dynamic expansion, leading to ever-increasing insights into topics as various as the origin of life, the nature of disease and the development of individual organisms.

Powerful new techniques, such as those of genome editing, super-resolution microscopy and CryoEM, enable us to analyse biological phenomena in more and more precise molecular terms.

These studies have led to extraordinary developments in our understanding of the molecular basis of life itself. We can also apply this new knowledge in an ever increasing variety of ways enabling rational drug design and synthesis, synthetic biology, environmental monitoring and a whole range of other areas. Furthermore, advances in biochemistry are largely responsible for the breakdown of traditional disciplinary boundaries between cell biology, medicine, physics and chemistry.

This revised and upgraded Oxford Biology course was first introduced in 2019. The structure of the course encourages a cross-disciplinary approach. Following an introduction to fundamental biological principles in the first year, the second and third years allow students to choose options of particular interest and specialise in these areas with increasing depth. The options cover a comprehensive range of topics, which currently include but are not limited to:

• animal behaviour and physiology
• cell biology
• conservation
• developmental biology
• disease biology and host-microbe interactions
• ecology
• evolutionary biology
• genomics
• plant physiology and molecular biology.

The course offers an optional fourth year. This means that students can either leave after three years with a BA or choose to stay on for the fourth year, where they complete an extended research project under the supervision of qualified academic staff. Progression to the fourth year is contingent on satisfactory academic performance in the second and third years.

The Biology degree is taught by the Department of Biology, with almost all teaching taking place in the University's Science Area. Additional resources include the Oxford University Museum of Natural History, the Botanic Garden, the Herbarium, the Arboretum, the John Krebs Field Station and Wytham Woods. There is a compulsory UK residential field course to study ecology in the first year. Optional residential field courses are also available in the second year.

The course puts a strong emphasis on research skills training, which is an integral part of teaching across all years. Compulsory skills training in the first year includes carefully selected dissections that have been designed with animal welfare and conservation principles in mind.

Skills training in the second year is also compulsory and covers a whole range of more advanced practical and quantitative skills essential to a modern biologist. In the last part of the second year, students choose from a range of extended skills courses that last one or two weeks. Examples include avian behaviour, digital morphology, ecological fieldwork, genome sequencing and genome editing, plant molecular biology, and technological applications to ecological monitoring.

In the third year, students specialise on a narrower range of options, and skills training continues in the form of journal clubs and computer classes."

The Biomedical Sciences course at Oxford has been designed so that students initially acquire an integrated understanding of biomedical science that allows them to shape their subsequent studies towards the topics that interest them the most.

Practical laboratory work forms an integral part of this programme and you will be required to complete these practical elements to a satisfactory standard in order to progress through the course.

As the course progresses, increasing emphasis is placed on scientific research, as students obtain first-hand experience of laboratory research in the later stages. Students choose their own project and the possible areas for investigation within the University are wide ranging.

Students can elect to graduate after three years with a BA degree. On the basis of the specialisation initiated by the selection of second-year modules and confirmed by the choice of third-year options, students will be awarded a degree in either Neuroscience or Cell and Systems Biology.

You can choose to specialise in what you find most interesting from each side of the course, taking a range of options in English literature, and in ancient literature, history, philosophy, and linguistics. But the degree also integrates the two sides of its course, offering several papers designed specifically for the kind of comparative work that the course encourages.

In the first year (second, for Classics and English with Beginners' Latin or Greek), students take a paper in English literature of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries – the period during which writers were most consistently and intensely engaged with the languages and literatures of ancient Greece and Rome.

Among the highlights of the latter two years are the four ‘link papers.’ All students take Epic, and read and compare authors such as Homer, Virgil, Milton, Alice Oswald, and Derek Walcott. Students then choose to take either Comedy, Tragedy, or Reception (in which you study the reception of ancient literature in 20th-century poetry). Students who choose to take up a second classical language in their penultimate year only take one of the link papers.

The final-year dissertation allows students to pursue an independently devised topic with an expert supervisor, which may combine the subjects or focus on an aspect of one of them. All of the courses allow students to pursue the twists and turns of literary genres across time.

All students study either Latin or Greek or both, so that they can encounter ancient literature in the original language(s).

Candidates with an A-level or equivalent in either Latin or Greek take a three-year course.

Candidates who have not had the opportunity to study either classical language to A-level or equivalent take Classics and English with Beginners’ Latin or Greek. This is a four-year course which includes a preliminary year, in which students learn Latin or Greek alongside some study of classical literature.

"">Video of Classics and English at Oxford University

You can choose to specialise in what you find most interesting from each side of the course, taking a range of options in English literature, and in ancient literature, history, philosophy, and linguistics. But the degree also integrates the two sides of its course, offering several papers designed specifically for the kind of comparative work that the course encourages.

In the first year (second, for Classics and English with Beginners' Latin or Greek), students take a paper in English literature of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries – the period during which writers were most consistently and intensely engaged with the languages and literatures of ancient Greece and Rome.

Among the highlights of the latter two years are the four ‘link papers.’ All students take Epic, and read and compare authors such as Homer, Virgil, Milton, Alice Oswald, and Derek Walcott. Students then choose to take either Comedy, Tragedy, or Reception (in which you study the reception of ancient literature in 20th-century poetry). Students who choose to take up a second classical language in their penultimate year only take one of the link papers.

The final-year dissertation allows students to pursue an independently devised topic with an expert supervisor, which may combine the subjects or focus on an aspect of one of them. All of the courses allow students to pursue the twists and turns of literary genres across time.

Oxford has a long and distinguished tradition of research and teaching in both Classics and English, and possesses remarkable library provision in both subjects.

Oxford has the largest Classics department in the world, with over sixty full-time academic staff-members. It has outstanding teaching, library and museum resources. Resources include the Bodleian and Bodleian Art, Archaeology and Ancient World Libraries, the Ashmolean Museum and a designated Classics Centre.

The English Faculty is the largest English department in Britain. Students are taught in tutorials by scholars active in their research field, many of whom also give lectures to all students in the English Faculty. You will therefore have the opportunity to learn from a wide range of specialist teachers.

Library provision for English at Oxford is exceptionally good. All students have access to:

• the Bodleian Library (with its extensive manuscript collection),
• the English Faculty Library,
• their own college libraries,
• and a wide range of electronic resources."

"">Video of Economics and Management at Oxford University

Economics is the study of how consumers, firms and governments make decisions that together determine how resources are allocated.

An appreciation of economics and the general workings of the economy have become increasingly necessary to understand:

• government policy-making
• the conduct of businesses
• and the enormous changes in economic systems which are occurring throughout the world.

It is also becoming increasingly important in both government and the private sector to have an understanding of some of the methods used within economics. This includes quantitative methods, statistical and causal inference, and experimental methods.

Management is concerned with the effective use and coordination of materials and labour within an organisation in the pursuit of its defined objectives.

Management considers the interrelationship and interactions between distinct parts of an organisation, and between the organisation and its environment. Students will look at theories, models and frameworks in order to understand how managers behave and to consider their role in the process of decision-making.

The teaching of this course is provided by both the Department of Economics and Saïd Business School. However, it is not a Business Studies degree. The programme is taught as an academic subject within the Social Sciences Division of the University."

The Department of Engineering Science at Oxford has a top-level quality assessment rating for teaching and a world-class reputation for research.

We believe that future engineering innovation will benefit from broad foundations as well as specialised knowledge. Because of this, undergraduate teaching is based on a unified course in Engineering Science, which integrates study of the subject across the traditional boundaries of engineering disciplines. Links between topics - in apparently diverse fields of engineering - provide well-structured fundamental understanding, and can be exploited to give efficient teaching.

The Engineering Science programme is a four-year course, leading to the degree of Master of Engineering. The first two years are devoted to topics that we believe all Engineering undergraduates should study.

In the third and fourth years there is scope for specialisation into one of six branches of engineering:

• Biomedical
• Chemical
• Civil
• Electrical
• Information
• Mechanical.

Decisions about which of these will be your specialisation can be deferred until the third year.

The course is accredited every five years by the major engineering institutions. Engineering Science is currently accredited by IChemE, IET, IMechE, InstMC and JBM on behalf of the Engineering Council for the purposes of fully meeting the academic requirement for registration as a Chartered Engineer.

As well as British literature, you can study works written in English from other parts of the world, and some originally written in other languages, allowing you to think about literature in English in multilingual and global contexts across time.

The course allows you a considerable degree of choice, both in developing your personal interests across core papers, and in choosing a topic for your dissertation and for a special option in your final year.

Options have included:

• Literature and revolution
• Postcolonial literature
• Writing lives
• Old Norse
• Tragedy
• Film criticism.

Studying literature at Oxford involves the development of sophisticated reading skills and of an ability to place literary texts in their wider intellectual and historical contexts. It also requires you to:

• consider the critical processes by which you analyse and judge
• learn about literary form and technique
• evaluate various approaches to literary criticism and theory
• study the development of the English language.

The Oxford English Faculty is the largest English department in Britain. Students are taught in tutorials by a scholar active in their research field, many of whom also give lectures to all students in the English Faculty. You will therefore have the opportunity to learn from a wide range of specialist teachers.

Library provision for English at Oxford is exceptionally good. All students have access to the Bodleian Library (with its extensive manuscript collection), the English Faculty Library, their own college libraries and a wide range of electronic resources.

In your first year, you will be introduced to the conceptual and technical tools used in the study of language and literature, and to a wide range of different critical approaches. At the same time, you will be doing tutorial work on early medieval literature, Victorian literature and literature from 1910 to the present.

In your second and third years, you will extend your study of English literary history in four more period papers ranging from late medieval literature to Romanticism. These papers are assessed by three-hour written examinations at the end of your third year. You will also produce:

• a portfolio of three essays on Shakespeare, on topics of your choice
• an extended essay (or occasionally an examination) relating to a special options paper, chosen from a list of around 25 courses
• and an 8,000-word dissertation on a subject of your choice.

Submitted work will constitute almost half of the final assessment for most students.

Alternatively, in the second and third years, you can choose to follow our specialist course in Medieval Literature and Language, with papers covering literature in English from 650-1550 along with the history of the English language up to 1800, with a further paper either on Shakespeare or on manuscript and print culture. Students on this course also take a special options paper and submit a dissertation on a topic of their choice."

The course aims to teach spoken fluency in colloquial and more formal situations, as well as the ability to write essays in the foreign language, and the ability to translate into and out of the foreign language with accuracy and sensitivity to a range of vocabulary, styles and registers. You will also develop your reading skills to a high level.

The study of literature gives you an understanding of other cultures that cannot be acquired solely through learning the language. It leads you into areas such as:

• gender studies
• popular culture
• theatre
• aesthetics
• anthropology
• art history
• ethics
• history
• philosophy
• politics
• psychology

Probability theory and statistics",A*AA,A*AA,39 (including core points) with 766 at HL,39,"Psychology has been defined as the science of mental life and its scope includes a wide variety of issues. It addresses such questions as: how do we perceive and understand the world around us? How do children acquire language? What predisposes two people to get on with each other? What causes schizophrenia?

Psychology at Oxford is a scientific discipline, involving the rigorous formulation and testing of ideas. It works through experiments and systematic observation rather than introspection.

The Oxford Experimental Psychology Department is widely regarded as one of the leading psychology departments in the UK. The department’s size and its commitment to excellence in teaching and research means there are typically four or five research seminars each week, in addition to undergraduate lectures and classes.

At present, there are particularly strong research groups in the fields of human cognitive processes, neuroscience, language, developmental psychology, social psychology and psychological disorders.

Students can elect to graduate after three years with a BA degree. Alternatively, they can decide to remain for an optional fourth year composed of a research-intensive, clinically-focused or translation-focused extended project.

Students who complete the fourth year will graduate with a Master’s degree in Experimental Psychology."

They are allocated a studio tutor each term, who monitors progress, sets targets and directs them in their studies.
Work is regularly presented and discussed at group critiques involving staff and students from across the school. Alongside this, workshops and projects are offered throughout the year to introduce a range of techniques and approaches to the making and curating of artwork.
In addition, students attend weekly anatomy classes (including visits to the Anatomy Suite at the Medical Sciences Teaching Centre), in which they explore, and produce work relating to, the human body.",AAA (or AAB for candidates who have undertaken or completed a post-18 Art Foundation course*),AAA,38 (including core points) with 666 at HL,38,"Fine Art is the making and study of visual art. It educates and prepares students to become artists and to follow other practices that are aligned with the making of art. The curriculum is centred on the individual student’s potential and imagination.

The Ruskin School of Art offers a three-year studio-based BFA course in which students work alongside each other in collaboratively-organised studios. Whereas many fine art courses run in an environment devoted exclusively to art and design, Ruskin students, as members of a collegiate university, have the advantage of contact with their contemporaries on all of Oxford’s other courses.

The Ruskin course aims to develop strong independent points of view and a mature grasp of the range of critical debate surrounding contemporary art and its many international histories. Oxford’s short terms, coupled with the ambitious atmosphere at the Ruskin, suit highly-motivated and resourceful students with a good sense of how to organise their time both in and out of Oxford.

The first year of the course is structured to introduce students to one another, to the resources of the school and to the staff involved in teaching and running the Ruskin. Students will familiarise themselves with their fellow students’ work, take part in group criticism and engage in intensive dialogue with tutors and visiting artists.

The intimate working environment of the school, arranged in two buildings, allows art history, theory and criticism to be treated as integral to the development of studio work. The Ruskin also enjoys a strong and constructive relationship with Modern Art Oxford (an exciting and influential contemporary art space) and other local and London-based arts organisations. Students also have full access to the many exceptional University libraries and museums, including the Ashmolean and the Bodleian Art, Archaeology and Ancient World Library."

Modern Languages have been taught in Oxford since 1724. The faculty is the largest in the country, with a total intake of more than 250 students a year (including joint courses).

Undergraduate students have access to the Taylor Institution Library, the biggest research library in Britain devoted to modern languages, and the University’s central library the Bodleian, as well as many online resources. The University’s well-equipped Language Centre has resources specifically tailored to the needs of Modern Language students.

Language is at the centre of the Oxford course, making up around 50% of both first-year and final examinations. The course aims to teach spoken fluency in colloquial and more formal situations, as well as the ability to write essays in the foreign language, and the ability to translate into and out of the foreign language with accuracy and sensitivity to a range of vocabulary, styles and registers. You will also develop your reading skills to a high level.

The study of literature gives you an understanding of other cultures that cannot be acquired solely through learning the language. It leads you into areas such as:

• gender studies
• popular culture
• theatre
• aesthetics
• anthropology
• art history
• ethics
• history

In your study of linguistics, you will be introduced to the analysis of the nature and structure of human language. This will include topics such as how words and sentences are formed, how we make and hear sounds, how languages change and vary and how language is organised in the brain, and you will apply these ideas to the study of your chosen language.

It provides enhancement of a broad range of transferable skills, and an education encompassing pressing issues at a range of scales, from local up to global.

The degree spans such key topics as:

• climate and environmental change
• inequality
• social, economic and cultural transformation
• biodiversity loss
• geomorphological processes in drylands
• geographical data science
• post-colonialism
• globalisation.

The Oxford Geography degree provides a holistic view of the workings of physical and human environments, the ways in which humans are transforming the world and the implications for human societies.

Students are introduced to the full range of geographical topics in the foundational courses, which they can then follow up in more detail in the optional papers, shaping their programme to match their developing interests.

There is emphasis placed on interdisciplinary approaches within the course, with opportunities to explore the intersections between geography and other disciplines from the humanities, social and natural sciences.

The facilities available at Oxford are among the best in the country. Field equipment used by students for fieldwork reports and dissertations include:

• Lidar systems for remote sensing of winds
• theodolites for tracking balloons to calculate winds in the lower atmosphere
• high specification systems for working with climate data.

The department also has well-equipped Geolabs for practical physical courses and individual research projects. These include the Geography Research and Teaching Labs, the Oxford Luminescence Dating Lab and the Oxford Resilient Buildings and Landscapes Lab.

Students are also trained in qualitative research methods that are particularly useful for human geography, such as:

• interviewing
• literature reviews
• archival research
• focus group and workshop facilitation
• ethnography.

There are opportunities to learn advanced data analysis and coding skills. The central and collegiate Library resources, electronically and in print are second to none."

Part of your course will consist of developing your practical language skills to a high level, and you will also explore the literature and culture of the relevant language.

In your study of linguistics, you will be introduced to the analysis of the nature and structure of human language. This will include topics such as how words and sentences are formed, how we make and hear sounds, how languages change and vary and how language is organised in the brain, and you will apply these ideas to the study of your chosen language.

"">Video of Modern Languages and Linguistics at Oxford University

Please note that the course video refers to the Linguistics Aptitude Test, which is no longer part of the admissions process.

The Faculty of Linguistics, Philology, and Phonetics has particular expertise in:

• general linguistics
• phonetics
• phonology
• syntax and semantics
• psycholinguistics
• the history and structure of many individual European languages and language families.

All these combine to offer a mutually reinforcing package. On the one hand, the theoretical study of what human language is and how it works. On the other, the detailed study of issues of language structure and change applied to the specific language you are studying.

You will find a wide range of options available, allowing you to concentrate on those areas you find most exciting.

Modern Languages have been taught in Oxford since 1724. The faculty is the largest in the country, with a total intake of more than 250 students a year (including joint courses).

Undergraduate students have access to the Taylor Institution Library, the biggest research library in Britain devoted to modern languages, and the University’s central library the Bodleian, as well as many online resources. The University’s well-equipped Language Centre has resources specifically tailored to the needs of Modern Language students.

Language is at the centre of the Oxford course, making up around 50% of both first-year and final examinations. The course aims to teach spoken fluency in colloquial and more formal situations, as well as the ability to write essays in the foreign language, and the ability to translate into and out of the foreign language with accuracy and sensitivity to a range of vocabulary, styles and registers. You will also develop your reading skills to a high level.

The study of literature gives you an understanding of other cultures that cannot be acquired solely through learning the language. It leads you into areas such as:

• gender studies
• popular culture
• theatre
• aesthetics
• anthropology
• art history
• ethics
• history
• philosophy
• politics
• psychology
• and religious studies.

These areas of study develop your skills as a critical reader, writer and thinker."

The combination allows insights that neither subject can realise alone. However, it is possible to specialise primarily in either history or economics while still preserving the benefits of an integrated approach.

The combination of economics, economic history and history will equip you to view real world issues from a variety of perspectives. You will learn both the historian’s careful approaches to evidence and argumentation and the economist’s analytical and quantitative methods. These approaches provide an excellent preparation for a range of professional, financial and academic careers.

The course is designed to equip you with the basic tools of both history and economics, while introducing you to some of the areas which you can study later in more depth.

You will be given a wide choice of subjects. Everyone studies Introductory economics, which is designed to give a solid understanding of the foundations of both Microeconomics, Macroeconomics and Statistical Methods. The economics core papers are identical to those for Philosophy, Politics and Economics (PPE) and Economics and Management and students for these courses are generally taught together.

In modern languages, as well as developing a high level of fluency and confidence in your language, you can study its thought and literature from medieval times right up to the present day, as well as twentieth- and twenty-first-century cinema.

Your studies can take you wherever your language is spoken, including post-colonial nations from Algeria to Argentina, perhaps inspiring you to explore some of them in person during the course’s year abroad.

Throughout the course you are encouraged to follow your interests, drawing connections between the history and modern languages sides of the course wherever and whenever is most fascinating to you. That includes the final-year dissertation project, which brings history and modern languages together in a combined study of a topic of your choice.

Oxford has a rich environment for the study of history and modern languages with teaching often led by world-leading experts, vast library resources, language training and overseas contacts. Undergraduate students have access to the Taylor Institution Library, the biggest research library in Britain devoted to modern languages. Our undergraduate students also have access to the History Faculty Library housed in the Radcliffe Camera.

History of Art aims to arrive at an historical understanding of the origins, meanings and purposes of art and artefacts from a wide range of world cultures. It asks about the circumstances of objects' making, their makers, the media used, their functions, their critical reception and their subsequent histories.

A degree in History of Art educates students in the historical interpretation of art in its cultural contexts. It also provides skills in the critical analysis of objects through the cultivation of visual literacy, as well as encourages students to analyse critically related texts and documents.

The acquired skills have broad applicability in a wide range of professional settings, as well as providing personal enlightenment and enjoyment.

The University's collections, including the famous Ashmolean and Pitt Rivers museums, provide objects for first-hand study under the supervision of those entrusted with their care. The historic architecture of the University, the city of Oxford and its environs supplies a rich source of study in its own right.

The Oxford degree is designed to provide innovative insights into a wide range of world art, drawing its expertise from various University faculties and the staff of University collections, as well as from the department itself.

There is a strong emphasis on how primary visual and written sources from various periods and places can be analysed in relation to works of art and architecture. Students are also encouraged to explore what it means to call something a work of 'Art' and to consider images and objects that may not necessarily conform to traditional definitions of 'Art'."

The degree allows students to make connections between biological, social and cultural phenomena.  Such connections are essential for addressing the major issues we face in a rapidly changing world. The programme offers an exciting and challenging alternative to more traditional undergraduate courses.

"">Video of Human Sciences at Oxford University

The BA in Human Sciences was founded in 1969 by specialists across a range of departments at the University. They recognised the need for an interdisciplinary understanding of fundamental issues and problems confronting human societies. This need is as critical now as it was then, as is reflected in the global intensification of interdisciplinary research across traditional subject boundaries in the decades since the degree began.

Central topics include:

• the evolution of humans and their behaviour
• molecular and population genetics
• population growth and ageing
• ethnic and cultural diversity
• and human interaction with the environment, including conservation, disease, and nutrition.

Within a framework of human diversity and sustainability, Human Scientists study the connections between human biology, evolution, genetics, development, psychology, behaviour, ecology, demography, society and culture. This helps them to develop professional competences suited to addressing multidimensional human problems.

The course is taught by specialists from across the University. Lectures introduce the material and provide the core concepts and theories for each paper. Tutorials allow students to consider particular topics in greater depth and draw connections across different perspectives and parts of the degree. They also allow students from different academic backgrounds to gain the necessary grounding across a range of competencies.

Option courses and dissertation preparation in the final year enable students to deepen their interdisciplinary training and expertise in particular topics of interest."

The course involves the application of creative reasoning, science, mathematics (and, of course, experience and common sense) to real problems.

The Department of Engineering Science at Oxford has a top-level quality assessment rating for teaching and a world-class reputation for research.

We believe that future engineering innovation will benefit from broad foundations as well as specialised knowledge. Because of this, undergraduate teaching is based on a unified course in Engineering Science, which integrates study of the subject across the traditional boundaries of engineering disciplines. Links between topics - in apparently diverse fields of engineering - provide well-structured fundamental understanding, and can be exploited to give efficient teaching.

The Engineering Science programme is a four-year course, leading to the degree of Master of Engineering. The first two years are devoted to topics that we believe all Engineering undergraduates should study.

In the third and fourth years there is scope for specialisation into one of six branches of engineering:

• Biomedical
• Chemical
• Civil
• Electrical
• Information
• Mechanical.

Decisions about which of these will be your specialisation can be deferred until the third year.

The course is accredited every five years by the major engineering institutions. Engineering Science is currently accredited by IChemE, IET, IMechE, InstMC and JBM on behalf of the Engineering Council for the purposes of fully meeting the academic requirement for registration as a Chartered Engineer.

• IET, IMechE, InstMC, IChemE: intakes up to 2027
• JBM: intakes up to 2025, 2026-2027 intakes pending review summer 2025

Industrial experience is an extremely important adjunct to an academic engineering education, and undergraduates are strongly encouraged to obtain it. One way to do so is by being sponsored. Further information is generally available through your careers teacher, or from the engineering institutions. If your sponsoring company wants you to spend a year with them before university, you will be asked to declare this at your interview and in your UCAS application."

Part of your course will consist of developing your practical language skills to a high level, and you will also explore the literature and culture of the relevant language.

In your study of linguistics, you will be introduced to the analysis of the nature and structure of human language. This will include topics such as how words and sentences are formed, how we make and hear sounds, how languages change and vary and how language is organised in the brain, and you will apply these ideas to the study of your chosen language.

"">Video of Modern Languages and Linguistics at Oxford University

Please note that the course video refers to the Linguistics Aptitude Test, which is no longer part of the admissions process.

The Faculty of Linguistics, Philology, and Phonetics has particular expertise in:

• general linguistics
• phonetics
• phonology
• syntax and semantics
• psycholinguistics
• the history and structure of many individual European languages and language families.

All these combine to offer a mutually reinforcing package. On the one hand, the theoretical study of what human language is and how it works. On the other, the detailed study of issues of language structure and change applied to the specific language you are studying.

You will find a wide range of options available, allowing you to concentrate on those areas you find most exciting.

• Course II (Law with Law Studies in Europe) is a four-year course.  It follows the same syllabus as Course I. However, the third year is taken abroad at a university in France, Germany, Italy or Spain (studying French, German, Italian or Spanish law respectively) or in the Netherlands (studying European and International law).

Students on Course II gain additional skills through exposure to different legal systems and the different approaches to teaching practised by our European partner institutions. In all countries, aside from the Netherlands, you will be expected to study in the local language.

Students who have graduated in other subjects may undertake the accelerated ‘Senior Status’ version of Course I. Please refer to the Law Faculty website for further information about the courses."

Modern society is heavily dependent on advanced materials, for example:

• lightweight composites for more efficient vehicles
• optical fibres for telecommunications
• and silicon microchips for the continuing revolution in digital technology.

Materials scientists study the relationships between the structure and properties of a material and how it is made. They also develop new materials and devise advanced processes for manufacturing them. Materials Science is vital for developments in nanotechnology, quantum computing, energy storage and nuclear energy, as well as medical technologies such as bone replacement materials and drug delivery.

"">Video of Materials Science at Oxford University

This diverse programme spans the subject from its foundations in physics and chemistry to the mechanical, electrical, magnetic and optical properties of materials, and the design, manufacture and applications of metals, alloys, ceramics, polymers, composites, semiconductors, superconductors, nanomaterials and biomaterials. This work is supported by excellent laboratory and teaching facilities.

The programme also offers an opportunity to develop an introductory understanding of entrepreneurship (learning how to write a business plan, raise capital and start a company). There are also voluntary options to learn a foreign language with the University's Language Centre.

The Oxford Materials degree includes in its fourth year the special feature of an eight-month full-time research project. For this fourth year research project you will join a research team either here at Oxford in one of the strongest Departments of Materials in the UK or, occasionally, at an overseas university or in an industrial laboratory (additional costs may be associated with a project outside Oxford). You will learn how to break down a complex problem, design an experiment or model, manage a project and communicate your results. These research skills are transferable to many career paths and are valued highly by employers."

Mathematical knowledge, and the ability to use it, is the most important means of tackling quantifiable problems. Philosophical training enhances the ability to analyse issues, question received assumptions and clearly articulate understanding. The combination provides a powerful background from which to proceed to graduate study in either mathematics or philosophy or to pursue a diverse range of careers.

Historically, there have been strong links between mathematics and philosophy. Logic, an important branch of both subjects, provides a natural bridge between the two, as does the Philosophy of mathematics module.

The degree is founded on the belief that the parallel study of these related disciplines can significantly enhance your understanding of each.

"">Video of Mathematics and Philosophy at Oxford University

The Philosophy Faculty is the largest in the UK, and one of the largest in the world. We have more than 70 full-time members and admit around 450 undergraduates annually to read our various degrees involving philosophy.

Many faculty members have a worldwide reputation, and the faculty has one of the highest research ratings of any philosophy department in the UK. The Philosophy Library is among the best in the country.

The large number of undergraduates and graduates reading philosophy with a variety of other disciplines affords the opportunity to participate in a diverse and lively philosophical community.

In turn the Mathematics Department, housed in the Andrew Wiles Building, is also one of the largest and best in the UK and contains within it many world-class research groups. This is reflected in the wide choice of mathematics topics available to you, especially in the fourth year."

In order to produce sensible theories and draw accurate conclusions from data, cutting-edge statistical methods are needed. These methods use advanced mathematical ideas combined with modern computational techniques, which require expert knowledge and experience to apply.

A degree in Mathematics and Statistics equips you with the requisite skills for developing and implementing these methods. The course provides a fascinating combination of deep and mathematically well-grounded method-building and wide-ranging applied work with data.

The Department of Statistics at Oxford is an exciting and dynamic place to study, with teaching and research strengths in a wide range of modern areas of statistical science. Many of its academic staff work in the development of fundamental statistical methodology and probability. There is a strong new research group working on statistical machine learning and scalable methods for Big Data.

The department has a world-leading team applying new statistical methods to huge genetic data sets in order to unlock the secrets of human genetic variation and disease. Other groups work on applied probability, network analysis, and medical, actuarial and financial applications.

The course involves the application of creative reasoning, science, mathematics (and, of course, experience and common sense) to real problems.

The Department of Engineering Science at Oxford has a top-level quality assessment rating for teaching and a world-class reputation for research.

We believe that future engineering innovation will benefit from broad foundations as well as specialised knowledge. Because of this, undergraduate teaching is based on a unified course in Engineering Science, which integrates study of the subject across the traditional boundaries of engineering disciplines. Links between topics - in apparently diverse fields of engineering - provide well-structured fundamental understanding, and can be exploited to give efficient teaching.

The Engineering Science programme is a four-year course, leading to the degree of Master of Engineering. The first two years are devoted to topics that we believe all Engineering undergraduates should study.

In the third and fourth years there is scope for specialisation into one of six branches of engineering:

• Biomedical
• Chemical
• Civil
• Electrical
• Information
• Mechanical.

Decisions about which of these will be your specialisation can be deferred until the third year.

The course is accredited every five years by the major engineering institutions. Engineering Science is currently accredited by IChemE, IET, IMechE, InstMC and JBM on behalf of the Engineering Council for the purposes of fully meeting the academic requirement for registration as a Chartered Engineer.

• IET, IMechE, InstMC, IChemE: intakes up to 2027
• JBM: intakes up to 2025, 2026-2027 intakes pending review summer 2025

Industrial experience is an extremely important adjunct to an academic engineering education, and undergraduates are strongly encouraged to obtain it. One way to do so is by being sponsored. Further information is generally available through your careers teacher, or from the engineering institutions. If your sponsoring company wants you to spend a year with them before university, you will be asked to declare this at your interview and in your UCAS application."

The standard Oxford medical course has separate pre-clinical (years 1-3) and clinical (years 4-6) components. Students first gain a comprehensive grounding in medical science, before applying that scientific foundation in the clinical setting.

Visit the A101 page to find out about our graduate-entry/accelerated medical degree.

The practice of Medicine offers a breadth of experiences impossible to find in any other subject. Every day brings different patients with different needs. It’s a great choice for scientists who strive to understand and apply research findings to improve the lives of the patients in their care. It offers a meaningful career that is prestigious, secure and well paid.

However, practising Medicine can be arduous, stressful, frustrating and bureaucratic and is not suited to everyone. You need to be sure that Medicine is the right choice for you. These pages will help you work that out, but there’s no better way to find out for sure than by gaining insight into medical practice by seeing it in action and talking to those who provide healthcare. Studying Medicine because that is what is expected of you is never a good idea; make sure that your motives for choosing to do so are well-reasoned.

The Medicine course at Oxford provides a thorough intellectual training with particular emphasis on the basic science research that underpins medicine. We have retained a distinct three-year pre-clinical stage that includes studying towards a BA Honours degree in Medical Sciences, followed by a three-year clinical stage.

The School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences at Oxford is relatively small, allowing students and staff to get to know one another and benefit from a relaxed and friendly atmosphere."

The course aims to teach spoken fluency in colloquial and more formal situations, as well as the ability to write essays in the foreign language, and the ability to translate into and out of the foreign language with accuracy and sensitivity to a range of vocabulary, styles and registers. You will also develop your reading skills to a high level.

The study of literature gives you an understanding of other cultures that cannot be acquired solely through learning the language. It leads you into areas such as:

• gender studies
• popular culture
• theatre
• aesthetics
• anthropology
• art history
• ethics
• history
• philosophy
• politics
• psychology
• and religious studies.

These areas of study develop your skills as a critical reader, writer and thinker."

At Oxford, we study music by reading, listening, performing and composing. We create music in all its aspects – acoustic, electronic, individually and communally, working with world-class professionals and with local communities. We analyse the relationships within a piece of music, and between that piece and its genre and context.

Throughout the course, you will be exposed to music of all kinds and in all contexts:

• Western classical
• popular music
• global, world and traditional musics
• community music
• seeing these musics in terms of their social and cultural contexts (and how those contexts have been shaped over time).

"">Video of Music at Oxford University

Music has been part of the life of Oxford for more than 800 years. There are around 30 academic staff, of whom 15 give lectures regularly – scholars with distinguished reputations as musicologists, performers and composers. Oxford welcomes visits from numerous speakers and professional performing ensembles.

From October 2025, the Faculty of Music will be located at the The Stephen A. Schwarzman Centre for the Humanities. This new state-of-the-art building includes a concert hall, lecture spaces, film screening theatre, black box experimental performance space, practice rooms and a multimedia digital TV broadcasting and sound studio. The world-famous Bate Collection of Musical Instruments, which lends historical instruments to students will also be moving to the new centre, along with the Faculty's gamelan orchestra.

The course is broadly based but allows increasing specialisation and choice as you proceed. Whether you’re a performer, a composer, a budding scholar of music history, sociology, psychology or education, the Music course offers something for you.

Students graduate as mature and well-rounded musicians with an informed and lively sense of the contemporary study and practice of the subject, and the ways in which music contributes to society more broadly."

The various courses offered by the Faculty present both the major traditions and cultural trends of the regions studied and, in most cases, their modern developments. All courses include a combination of linguistic, literary, historic and cultural studies. There is a wide range of options in fields such as art and archaeology, history, literature, philosophy, religion and modern social studies.

Asian and Middle Eastern Studies has a long history in Oxford. The Bodleian and other libraries possess extensive collections. These include the Nizami Ganjavi Library, the KB Chen China Centre Library and the Bodleian Japanese Library which contain significant collections in their respective fields.

Around the corner from the Faculty building on Pusey Lane is the Ashmolean Museum, which houses superb collections relevant to Asian and Middle Eastern Studies.

Psychology
Philosophy
Linguistics
Neurophysiology
Probability theory and statistics",A*AA,A*AA,39 (including core points) with 766 at HL,39,"Psychology, Philosophy and Linguistics (PPL) are closely interrelated disciplines, so studying a combination of them allows students to explore different aspects of each subject, resulting in a very varied and dynamic course.

Psychology addresses such questions as: how do we perceive and understand the world around us? How do children acquire language? What predisposes two people to get on with each other? What causes schizophrenia?

Philosophy is concerned with a wide range of questions including ethics, knowledge, and the nature of mind.

Linguistics is the study of language in all its aspects, including the structure of languages, meaning (semantics), pronunciation, and how people understand, mentally represent and generate language.

Psychology at Oxford is a scientific discipline, involving the rigorous formulation and testing of ideas. It works through experiments and systematic observation rather than introspection. Data science and coding play an important role in how we train students.

The Oxford Experimental Psychology Department is widely regarded as one of the leading psychology departments in the UK. At present, there are particularly strong groups in the fields of human cognitive processes, neuroscience, language, developmental, social psychology and psychological disorders.

The Oxford Philosophy Faculty is one of the largest Philosophy departments in the world, and regularly tops international rankings. Philosophers at Oxford have active interests in the philosophy of language and of logic, philosophy of mind, and the philosophy of science, and maintain close links with those working in neuroscience and psychology.

The Faculty of Linguistics, Philology, and Phonetics brings together scholars working in:

• theoretical and descriptive linguistics (especially syntax, semantics and phonology)
• experimental phonetics
• psycholinguistics
• linguistics of the Romance languages
• historical linguistics and comparative philology.

Unlike other subjects in the humanities, it includes two scientific research laboratories – the Language and Brain Laboratory and the Phonetics Laboratory.

Students taking Psychology as one of their subjects can elect to graduate after three years with a BA degree. Alternatively, they can decide to remain for an optional fourth year composed of a research-intensive, clinically-focused or translation-focused extended project in Experimental Psychology and allied disciplines. Students who complete the fourth year will graduate with a Master’s degree in PPL."

The study of Philosophy develops analytical rigour and the ability to criticise and reason logically. It allows you to apply these skills to many contemporary and historical schools of thought and individual thinkers. You will also apply these skills to questions ranging from how we acquire knowledge and form moral judgements to central questions in the philosophy of religion, including the existence and nature of God and the relevance of religion to human life.

The study of Theology provides an understanding of the intellectual underpinning of religious traditions and of the social and cultural contexts for religious belief and practice. It brings together a wide range of skills and disciplines, historical, textual, linguistic, sociological, literary-critical and philosophical.

Central to this degree is a recognition that parallel study of these related disciplines leads to a deeper understanding of each.

The Philosophy Faculty is the largest in the UK and one of the largest in the world. Many faculty members have a worldwide reputation, and its library and other facilities are acknowledged as among the best in the country.

The Faculty of Theology and Religion includes more than 100 academics, including experts in the ancient languages and literature of the world’s religions, historians and systematic theologians. The Faculty’s reputation and excellent library facilities attract scholars from all over the world."

Philosophy
General philosophy
Moral philosophy
Elementary logic
Politics
The theory of politics (introductory political theory)
The practice of politics (introductory comparative government and politics)
Political analysis (introductory empirical and quantitative methods)
Economics
Microeconomics: the functioning of the market economy
Macroeconomics: dealing with national output and employment, exchange rates and policy issues
Mathematical and statistical techniques used in economics",AAA,AAA,39 (including core points) with 766 at HL,39,"Philosophy, Politics and Economics (PPE) arose from the belief that the advanced study of all three subjects would transform students’ intellectual lives, to great social benefit. This conviction remains as firm today as it was then. As the world has evolved, so has PPE. The course brings together some of the most important approaches to understanding the world around us, developing skills useful for a wide range of careers and activities.

PPE is a highly flexible degree which allows you to shape your own path through it. You may choose to specialise in two branches at the end of the first year, or continue with all three. You can also explore a wide variety of disciplines under the overarching headings of Philosophy, Politics and Economics. For example, you can specialise in Sociology or International Relations by choosing the relevant Politics options.

The three subjects each make a distinctively valuable contribution to the degree. Studying philosophy develops analytical, critical, and logical rigour – a highly transferable skill – through discussion of deep, puzzling questions such as 'what can we (really) know?' and 'why be moral?' that are fascinating in their own right.

In turn, the study of politics provides a thorough understanding of the impact of political institutions on modern societies. It helps you to evaluate the choices that political systems must regularly make, to explain the processes that maintain or change those systems, and to examine the concepts and values used in political analysis.

Economics is the study of how consumers, firms and government make decisions that collectively determine how resources are allocated. An appreciation of economics has become increasingly necessary to make sense of governmental policy-making, the conduct of businesses and the enormous economic transformations throughout the world.

All three branches of PPE at Oxford have an international reputation, supported by more than 200 renowned scholars."

Discoveries in physics have formed the foundation of countless technological advances and play an important role in many scientific areas. Many techniques used in medical imaging, nanotechnology and quantum computing are derived from physics instrumentation. Even the World Wide Web was a spin-off from the information processing and communications requirements of high-energy particle physics.

The contributions of physics to solving global problems such as energy production, environmental protection, global warming and public health are essential and have an enormous impact on our society.

Oxford has one of the largest university physics departments in the UK, with an outstanding and very diverse research programme in six sub-departments:

• Astrophysics
• Atmospheric, Oceanic and Planetary Physics
• Atomic and Laser Physics
• Condensed Matter Physics (including BioPhysics)
• Particle Physics
• Theoretical Physics.

Physics at Oxford is challenging and mathematical with a strong emphasis on fundamental concepts such as optics and relativity.

There are two undergraduate courses, an MPhys and the BA. All applicants apply for the four-year MPhys in the first instance. The fourth-year MPhys option courses bring you to the threshold of current research, and can lead to subject specialism.

The department is equipped with state-of-the-art lecture facilities and teaching laboratories. Tutorials give students direct and regular access to physicists actively involved in research and provide an opportunity to explore scientific ideas with experts in the field."

Physics is concerned with unravelling the complexities of the universe from the smallest to the largest scale. Philosophy deals with foundational questions of the most general kind: what there is, what we know and how we came to know it, and how we ought to act and structure our lives.

Central to both subjects is the development and application of clear and precise thinking to foundational problems, the questioning of received wisdom and the critical articulation of ideas which aim for an understanding of how things are, in the broadest possible terms.

"">Video of Physics and Philosophy at Oxford University

Physics and Philosophy are historically intertwined and each continues to contribute to developments in the other.

Philosophy played a crucial role in the two revolutions of 20th-century physics – namely, relativity and quantum mechanics. It continues to contribute both to foundational research in theoretical physics and to the articulation and critique of scientific method. Conversely, discoveries in physics provide profound implications for philosophical inquiry, such as the nature of space and time and the behaviour of matter at the quantum realm.

Students on this course can expect to investigate not only central developments in both subjects, but also this interplay.

Oxford has one of the largest physics departments in the UK, with over 100 academics leading research that spans the breadth of physics. This expertise ensures the curriculum is updated in the light of developments in research.

The Philosophy Faculty is the largest in the UK, with more than 70 full-time members; it admits around 450 undergraduates annually to read the various degrees involving Philosophy.

The Oxford research group in Philosophy of Physics is the largest in the world. It has interests ranging from classical space-time theories and foundations of classical statistical mechanics, to quantum mechanics, quantum field theory and quantum gravity.

Philosophy of Physics runs through the first three years of the course.

In the first year students delve into 18th-century investigations into matter and motion.

In Years 2 and 3 they investigate the philosophical foundations of relativity and quantum mechanics.

The fourth-year MPhysPhil options bring you to the threshold of current research. In this year students may specialise in either Physics or Philosophy, or continue with a combination, including advanced study in the Philosophy of Physics. Alternatively, students may complete the course in three years, leaving with a BA."

Psychology addresses such questions as: how do we perceive and understand the world around us? How do children acquire language? What predisposes two people to get on with each other? What causes schizophrenia?

Philosophy is concerned with a wide range of questions including ethics, knowledge, and the nature of mind.

Linguistics is the study of language in all its aspects, including the structure of languages, meaning (semantics), pronunciation, and how people understand, mentally represent and generate language.

Psychology at Oxford is a scientific discipline, involving the rigorous formulation and testing of ideas. It works through experiments and systematic observation rather than introspection. Data science and coding play an important role in how we train students.

The Oxford Experimental Psychology Department is widely regarded as one of the leading psychology departments in the UK. At present, there are particularly strong groups in the fields of human cognitive processes, neuroscience, language, developmental, social psychology and psychological disorders.

The Oxford Philosophy Faculty is one of the largest Philosophy departments in the world, and regularly tops international rankings. Philosophers at Oxford have active interests in the philosophy of language and of logic, philosophy of mind, and the philosophy of science, and maintain close links with those working in neuroscience and psychology.

The Faculty of Linguistics, Philology, and Phonetics brings together scholars working in:

• theoretical and descriptive linguistics (especially syntax, semantics and phonology)
• experimental phonetics
• psycholinguistics
• linguistics of the Romance languages
• historical linguistics and comparative philology.

Unlike other subjects in the humanities, it includes two scientific research laboratories – the Language and Brain Laboratory and the Phonetics Laboratory.

Students taking Psychology as one of their subjects can elect to graduate after three years with a BA degree.

To engage with all the different aspects of the course, you will have to become something of a historian and a philosopher, a textual and literary critic, as well as an accomplished linguist. These disciplines together, not only enable students to appreciate the qualities of religions that can be radically different from those in Western societies, but also equip graduates with the analytical and critical abilities to embark on a wide range of careers.

Religion and Asian and Middle Eastern Studies enables students to study a major world religion through its primary texts in their original languages. It provides them with an understanding of the intellectual underpinning of religious traditions, and of the social and cultural contexts for religious beliefs and practices. Students can also explore topics such as the relationship between religions and science, and the place of religious ethics in public life.

Between them, the Faculties of Theology and Religion and Asian and Middle Eastern Studies include more than 270 academics, ranging from experts in the ancient languages and literature of the world’s religions to church historians and systematic theologians.

All courses include a combination of linguistic, literary, historic and cultural studies. There is a wide range of options in fields such as art and archaeology, history, literature, philosophy, religion and modern social studies.

In your study of linguistics, you will be introduced to the analysis of the nature and structure of human language. This will include topics such as how words and sentences are formed, how we make and hear sounds, how languages change and vary and how language is organised in the brain, and you will apply these ideas to the study of your chosen language.

Please note that the course video refers to the Linguistics Aptitude Test, which is no longer part of the admissions process.

The Faculty of Linguistics, Philology, and Phonetics has particular expertise in:

• general linguistics
• phonetics
• phonology
• syntax and semantics
• psycholinguistics
• the history and structure of many individual European languages and language families.

All these combine to offer a mutually reinforcing package. On the one hand, the theoretical study of what human language is and how it works. On the other, the detailed study of issues of language structure and change applied to the specific language you are studying.

Modern Languages have been taught in Oxford since 1724. The faculty is the largest in the country, with a total intake of more than 250 students a year (including joint courses).

Undergraduate students have access to the Taylor Institution Library, the biggest research library in Britain devoted to modern languages, and the University’s central library the Bodleian, as well as many online resources. The University’s well-equipped Language Centre has resources specifically tailored to the needs of Modern Language students.

Language is at the centre of the Oxford course, making up around 50% of both first-year and final examinations. The course aims to teach spoken fluency in colloquial and more formal situations, as well as the ability to write essays in the foreign language, and the ability to translate into and out of the foreign language with accuracy and sensitivity to a range of vocabulary, styles and registers. You will also develop your reading skills to a high level.

The study of literature gives you an understanding of other cultures that cannot be acquired solely through learning the language. It leads you into areas such as:

• gender studies
• popular culture
• theatre
• aesthetics
• anthropology
• art history
• ethics
• history
• philosophy
• politics
• psychology
• and religious studies.

These areas of study develop your skills as a critical reader, writer and thinker."

"">Video of Undergraduate Study at Oxford&#039;s Faculty of Theology and Religion

(Please note that this video refers to the course BA Religion and Oriental Studies, which has since been retitled BA Religion and Asian and Middle Eastern Studies.)

In order to engage fully with the questions raised by the critical study of Theology and Religion, you will have to become something of a historian and a philosopher, a textual and literary critic, and a linguist. The range of disciplines that may be encountered on the course makes study vibrant and challenging and means that our graduates are versatile and equipped with a variety of skills.

Oxford has been at the very heart of religious debate, reform and turmoil in the British Isles for eight centuries and so the faculty here wears a mantle of history not available in many other universities. At the same time Theology and Religion at Oxford is embracing its 21st-century context: students have the opportunity to study five major world religions and their primary languages. They can also explore the relationship between religion and science, the philosophy of religion and the place of religious ethics in public life.

On completion of this course you will have gained knowledge and understanding of different religious traditions. You will have thought about what a religion is and how to approach learning about it. You will have studied the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament, the development of Christian doctrine in its historical context, and the thought of modern theologians. In doing so you will be required to study a wide variety of texts, which will develop your critical, analytical and comparative skills.

You will also acquire competence in at least one of six languages and should find that being able to read sacred texts in their original language is a deeply satisfying experience.

Members of the Faculty of Theology and Religion include more than 100 academics, including experts in the ancient languages and literature of the world’s religions, church historians and systematic theologians. The faculty’s reputation and excellent library facilities attract scholars from all over the world."

The various courses offered by the Faculty present both the major traditions and cultural trends of the regions studied and, in most cases, their modern developments. All courses include a combination of linguistic, literary, historic and cultural studies. There is a wide range of options in fields such as art and archaeology, history, literature, philosophy, religion and modern social studies.

Asian and Middle Eastern Studies has a long history in Oxford. The Bodleian and other libraries possess extensive collections. These include the Nizami Ganjavi Library, the KB Chen China Centre Library and the Bodleian Japanese Library which contain significant collections in their respective fields.

Around the corner from the Faculty building on Pusey Lane is the Ashmolean Museum, which houses superb collections relevant to Asian and Middle Eastern Studies. Nearby are also the Leopold Muller Memorial Library at the Clarendon Institute for Hebrew and Jewish Studies material, and the Bodleian Art, Archaeology and Ancient World Library. The Bodleian Art, Archaeology and Ancient World Library contains the renowned Griffith Institute Archive, one of the finest collections in the world for the study of ancient Egypt and the Ancient Near East."
