They also learn how to design algorithms and software for the next generation of autonomous and robotic systems, which extract information from data and make automatic decisions on how to interpret and react to this information.The Department’s common first year programme gives all students the same solid academic grounding in the engineering skills and theory you’ll need for whichever route you choose next, and you’ll have the opportunity to ask all the questions to help you decide your next move.A focus on highly practical lab work will help underpin your understanding of the theory. You will develop your programming skills by learning C++. Year two follows a core programme tailored to your chosen route, completing the fundamentals in analogue and digital electronics, power electronics, communications and control, alongside a strong focus on mathematics and computing.In your third and final year, you’ll select from a number of more advanced technical modules, so you can choose to take a wide-ranging programme of study, or to concentrate your expertise in a particular field.You’ll apply your knowledge and skills to increasingly ambitious project work throughout the course, ultimately showcasing your imagination, creativity and independent engineering expertise in a substantial final year project of your choice."
